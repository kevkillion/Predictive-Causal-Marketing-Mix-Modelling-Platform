## 🧩 Overview  
This repository showcases a **next-generation Bayesian Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) framework** designed for **predictive, causal, and comparative analysis** across multiple media channels — including **SEM, Social, TV, Radio, OOH, and Digital Video**.  

Developed using **PyMC** for Bayesian inference, **MLflow** for version tracking, and **Power BI** for interactive analysis, the platform allows **multi-model testing and cross-validation** against alternative modelling frameworks such as **Meridian (Google)** and **Robyn (Meta)** to benchmark and confirm results consistency.  

It empowers marketing and data science teams to move beyond single-model dependency, using **frequentist and Bayesian triangulation** to identify the most reliable media ROI estimates and inform optimal budget reallocation.

## 💡 Key Features  

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔮 **Bayesian MMM Engine** | Built in **PyMC**, the platform estimates both immediate and delayed media effects using Adstock and Hill transformations — capturing saturation, diminishing returns, and carryover with full posterior distributions. |
| 🧠 **Causal Inference & Halo Modelling** | Quantifies **indirect effects** and **cross-channel synergies** using structural causal models and interaction terms to measure true incremental value. |
| 🧩 **Multi-Model Selection & Testing** | Integrates **multiple MMM frameworks** (PyMC Bayesian, Meridian Frequentist, Robyn Lasso) within the same workflow for side-by-side comparison, ensuring cross-validated, stable outcomes. |
| 🧪 **Rigorous Cross-Validation Framework** | Performs **train-test splits, k-fold validation, and baseline model confirmation** to test reliability, predictive accuracy, and out-of-sample generalisation. |
| ⚙️ **MLflow Tracking & Version Control** | Logs every model run, hyperparameter, and posterior trace, enabling transparent replication, comparison, and tuning. |
| 📊 **Power BI Multi-Model Analytics Platform** | Enables **filterable model selection** — compare Bayesian vs. frequentist outputs, view elasticity curves, ROI matrices, and channel prioritisations interactively. |
| ☁️ **Partitioned Cloud Data Architecture** | Uses BigQuery or Delta Lake with partitioned datasets for efficient retraining, scalability, and time-based analysis. |

## 🧠 Architecture Overview  

| Layer | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Data Layer** | BigQuery, Python, Pandas | Aggregates multi-channel spend, sales, and contextual data across time and markets. |
| **Transformation Layer** | PySpark, Python | Applies Adstock, Hill, lag optimisations, and seasonal controls to produce model-ready data. |
| **Model Layer** | PyMC, Robyn (Meta), Meridian (Google) | Fits multiple MMMs — Bayesian (PyMC), Frequentist Ridge/Lasso (Robyn/Meridian) — for triangulated benchmarking. |
| **Validation Layer** | Cross-Validation, MAPE/R² | Executes **multi-fold validation** to assess model stability, predictive reliability, and consistency across time and channels. |
| **Tracking Layer** | MLflow | Centralised run logging and version comparison for transparent model lifecycle management. |
| **Analytics Layer** | Power BI | Visualises model results, ROI by channel, and multi-model comparisons through interactive filters and scenario selectors. |
